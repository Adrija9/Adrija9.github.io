This project consisted of two sub-projects: one experimental and the other computational. 

Analyzing the effect of incorporating graphene oxide into colloidal photonic crystals
======
In the first project, we synthesised silica colloidal photonic crystals and examined the effect of incorporating carbon-based materials such as graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and graphene quantum dots into the synthesised colloidal photonic crystals (CPCs). Though we expected the colour of CPCs to brighten after graphene incorporation, we observed the colour shifting to higher wavelengths, rendering it colourless. 

Developing an android Application to detect the colour change in colloidal photonic crystals
======
The second project was mainly supplementary work for helping a PhD student in the lab who was working on colour-changing aerogels depending on the moisture content/humidity in the atmosphere. I developed an Android application for a CPC-based glucose sensor that can change colour according to glucose concentration. The developed app displayed the analyte(glucose) concentration according to the colour of the CPC. This logic was then applied to the humidity sensor work. I will be having a publication as a co-author for contribution to this project, the manuscript of which is prepared and will be submitted within the next few months.
