B.Tech Project: Irreversible thermodynamics-based approach to model flow stress for Monel 400 alloy
======
This project is being supervised by Prof. Surya Deo Yadav, Department of Metallurgical Engineering at our University. 
Plastic deformation is a result of the generation of dislocations and their consequent interaction with solute atoms or other dislocations. Mapping different dislocation mechanisms can help us produce a flow stress curve, eliminating the need for time-consuming experiments. This project aims to model a flow-stress curve of Monel 400 alloy, having a composition of 64.7 wt% Ni and 31.96 wt% Cu, using the irreversible thermodynamics approach. The model takes into account the change in entropy due to different dislocation mechanisms and other related long-range and short-range interactions. The flow stress behaviour is modelled for two specimens of different grain sizes, each being deformed at five different temperatures and is validated by performing the appropriate experiments.
