Advances in Additive Manufacturing Techniques for Electrochemical Energy Storage
I am currently writing a literature review on the above-mentioned topic under the supervision of Prof. Seeram Ramakrishna, NUS Singapore. The manuscript is prepared, and we will be submitting it in Batteries-MDPI Journal before August 30.

Abstract of the review paper
========
The increasing adoption of additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is revolutionizing the production of wearable electronics and energy storage devices such as batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. This surge can be attributed to its outstanding process versatility, precise control over geometrical aspects, and potential to reduce costs and material waste. In this comprehensive review, major AM processes like inkjet printing, direct ink writing, fused deposition modelling, and selective laser sintering/melting along with possible configurations and architectures, are elaborately discussed for each bespoke energy storage device. The application of 3D-printed energy storage devices in wearable electronics, IoT-based devices, and electric vehicles are also mentioned in the review. The role of AM in facilitating the production of solid-state batteries has also revolutionized the EV industry. Recent progress in the field of additive manufacturing of energy systems with solid electrolytes and potential future directions such as 4D printing to in-corporate stimuli-responsive behaviour in 3D-printed materials, biomimetic design optimization, and additive manufacturing of energy storage systems in a micro-gravity environment have also been highlighted. Extensive research and continuous progress in this field is expected to enhance the long-term stability, industrial scalability and electrochemical performance of 3D-printed energy storage devices in future.
