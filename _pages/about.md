**Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. -Bill Bradley**

Hello there! I am a passionate and curious metallurgical engineering undergraduate with a keen passion for the fascinating world of mechanical metallurgy, micro-mechanical modelling and additive manufacturing. Currently, I am pursuing my studies at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) BHU Varanasi, India at the Department of Metallurgical Engineering.

My Journey
======
As a relentless research and space enthusiast, I always wanted to contribute to the domain of space systems and technologies. However, I was confused and unsure about my specific field of interest at the beginning of my academic journey. After doing my first research internship on photonics in a government research lab (CSIR-NIIST), I realised that I have good computational skills. Though photonics was an intriguing subject, it was out of my domain. During my further coursework, I gradually developed an interest in mechanical metallurgy and started working on projects related to mechanical design and mechanical modelling under the supervision of my university professors. My recent internship at IIT Roorkee and NUS, Singapore, where I worked on projects related to additive manufacturing, further motivated me to contribute to this field in the future. Additive Manufacturing and In-situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) have recently gained popularity in the domain of space technologies with the increasing hype of colonising the Moon and Mars. I wish to pursue a PhD in the above-mentioned research areas abroad in the near future.

My inquisitive nature and relentless pursuit of knowledge have led me to delve into the depths of mechanical modelling, seeking to unravel the complexities of materials behaviour under different mechanical loading conditions. Through my academic journey, I have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, allowing me to critically examine data and draw meaningful insights to enhance the performance and reliability of advanced materials.

Seeking Research Internship Opportunities
======
I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and the collective brilliance that emerges when passionate minds come together. As an aspiring researcher, I am eager to work alongside seasoned professionals and mentors, ready to contribute my fresh perspective, dedication, and willingness to learn.

I am actively seeking research internship opportunities that align with my research interests in mechanical metallurgy, mechanical modelling and additive manufacturing. If you have exciting projects or opportunities on the horizon, I would be thrilled to be part of the team, contributing my enthusiasm and skills to the pursuit of knowledge and innovation.
