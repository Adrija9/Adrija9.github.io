This internship was funded by the SPARK IIT Roorkee program to carry out a research project at the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department under the supervision of Prof. Vivek Pancholi. 
<br/>
My work was mainly related to mechanical metallurgy, and focused on developing a functionally gradient material (FGM) using Friction Stir Additive Manufacturing (FSAM). While this internship differed from my previous one in terms of its level of excitement and depth of insight, it presented its own set of challenges and opportunities. Working with heavy equipment could be overwhelming at times, but it was a valuable learning experience in terms of hands-on skills. 
<br/>
We successfully developed a Functionally Graded Material (FGM) with remarkable corrosion resistance, surpassing that of conventional Al-Cu alloys by a factor of eight. One of the most rewarding aspects of this internship was the opportunity to collaborate with fellow interns from diverse backgrounds. We shared experiences and insights, enriching the overall learning experience. Additionally, our internship culminated in a poster session where we each had the chance to present our individual projects. This event provided me with a platform to articulate my findings and engage with professors from various domains, fostering a dynamic and enriching exchange of ideas.
