ABSTRACT
========
Growing global interest in sustainability have always attracted ‘nanocellulose’ as a green 
candidate in vast areas of applications. Here, we report Co2+ cation-induced malonic 
acid/nanocellulose aerogels that show reversible thermochromism. The transition from 
tetrahedral to octahedral geometry upon the interaction with water molecules in the moisture 
is behind this thermochromism. The high surface area behaviour of aerogel structures makes this 
phenomenon more enhanced. Co(II) ions and malonic acid as components ensured the 
coordination and crosslinking functions by employing interactions with an extrinsic number of 
functional groups in TEMPO-oxidised cellulose nanofibers (TCNF) leading to the formation of 
hierarchically porous aerogel structures. Detailed characterisations of synthesised aerogels 
were carried out to evaluate the overall properties and performance. The reversible 
thermochromism performance of these hybrid aerogels was utilized for visible humidity sensing by
designing an Android application. This green pathway of aerogel formation can be adopted for 
many vast areas with diverse metal ions and additives upon requirements.
